    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

    <p>
        I was born and grow up in Shanghai and I'm now studying at IIT Institute of Design in Chicago. My background was industrial
        design, and now I focus more on user experience research and design. As a designer, I enjoy exploring the world.
        I think design is about understanding people, using creative way to solve current problems and creating value. And
        that is where my passion is.
