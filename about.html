    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

    <p>
        I was born and grow up in Shanghai and I'm now studying at IIT Institute of Design in Chicago. My background was industrial design, and now I focus more on user experience research and design.

        As a designer, I enjoy exploring the world. I think design is about understanding people, using creative way to solve current problems and creating value. And that is where my passion is.
