    <h3>A little bit about me</h3>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm Jingwen Yang. Some people love to call me 波波堂 (seems like bo-bo-town). It is not a town, but me!

    <p>
        I was born and grow up in Shanghai and I'm now studying at IIT Institute of Design in Chicago. My background was industrial
        design, and now I focus more on user experience design, design research and strategy. As a designer, I enjoy exploring
        the world. I think design is about understanding people, using creative way to solve current problems and creating
        value. And that is where my passion is.
